# InventoryHub
A full-stack integrated application that uses Blazor WASM for the front-end and ASP.NET Core Web API for the back-end. This application is initially integrated, and since I am still mastering the pipelining, I have purposely left it that way, as I might change it later. The concept of the integrated application is that the front-end and back-end share the same domain model and data transfer object, which reduces duplication, maintains consistency, and simplifies maintenance.
